					<h4>El Dorado Arts Council</h4>
					<p>El Dorado Arts Council (EDAC) is an arts non-profit bringing more arts, in more places, to more people.</p>
                    <p>EDAC contracted us to rebuild their website from scratch. The goal of this project was to create
                    a minimal starting point from which to expand. To do this we focused on building small modular
                    components (calendar, cms, store, etc) which could grow along with the organizationâ€™s long term goals.</p>
					<p>Tool Kit: Bootstrap, Express, Heroku, Hogan, NodeJS, AngularJS, MongoDB, AWS, Stripe, ect.</p>

					<p>The Napa ARTwalk is a city sponsored art walk which supports the creation of original, high-quality and collaborative sculpture from regional artists.</p>
